# 🦵 sEMG-Knee-Abnormality-Detection

### **Detecting Knee Abnormalities and Human Activities using Convolutional Transformer Capsule Networks**

---

## 🧠 Overview

This repository presents my undergraduate **research work** on analyzing **surface Electromyography (sEMG)** signals to detect **knee abnormalities** and recognize **human activities** such as **walking**, **sitting**, and **standing**.  

The project integrates **signal processing** and **deep learning architectures** — combining **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Transformers**, and **Capsule Networks** — to model both local and temporal dependencies in EMG signals.  

The system achieved **67% generalization accuracy** in identifying lower-limb disorders, providing foundational work for **rehabilitation**, **prosthetic limb control**, and **assistive robotics**.

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- Detect **knee joint abnormalities** from sEMG signals using deep learning.
- Predict **human activity states** — sitting, standing, walking — based on muscle electrical signals.
- Support the development of **prosthetic legs** and **rehabilitation systems** by interpreting muscle movement patterns.
- Explore advanced architectures like **Capsule Networks** and **Transformers** for biomedical time-series analysis.

---

## 🧩 Research Motivation

The project aims to contribute to **intelligent prosthetics** and **rehabilitation engineering**.  
By decoding muscle activation signals, a prosthetic or robotic limb can:
- Understand the **intent** of motion (e.g., start walking, sit down).
- Adjust its movement accordingly.
- Support people recovering from injuries or with movement disabilities.

This work bridges **deep learning**, **biomedical signal processing**, and **assistive robotics**.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### 🧾 **Model Architecture**
- **Input:** 1-D sEMG time-series data
- **Processing:**
  - Convolutional layers → extract local spatial patterns.
  - Transformer Encoder → capture temporal dependencies across signals.
  - Capsule Network → preserve hierarchical spatial relationships.
- **Output:** Classified activity / abnormality state.

### 🧮 **Key Techniques Used**
| Technique | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Signal Preprocessing** | Normalization, segmentation, and feature scaling of EMG data |
| **CNN Layers** | Capture local activation features |
| **Transformer Encoder** | Understand long-term dependencies |
| **Capsule Layers** | Retain spatial hierarchy and reduce information loss |
| **Softmax Output** | Classifies activity and abnormality type |

### 🧪 **Performance**
- **Accuracy:** 67% (Cross-subject generalization)
- **Dataset:** Custom sEMG dataset collected across multiple subjects and activities
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow / PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
