# ü¶µ sEMG-Knee-Abnormality-Detection

### **Detecting Knee Abnormalities and Human Activities using Convolutional Transformer Capsule Networks**

---

## üß† Overview

This repository presents my undergraduate **research work** on analyzing **surface Electromyography (sEMG)** signals to detect **knee abnormalities** and recognize **human activities** such as **walking**, **sitting**, and **standing**.  

The project integrates **signal processing** and **deep learning architectures** ‚Äî combining **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Transformers**, and **Capsule Networks** ‚Äî to model both local and temporal dependencies in EMG signals.  

The system achieved **67% generalization accuracy** in identifying lower-limb disorders, providing foundational work for **rehabilitation**, **prosthetic limb control**, and **assistive robotics**.

---

## üéØ Research Objectives

- Detect **knee joint abnormalities** from sEMG signals using deep learning.
- Predict **human activity states** ‚Äî sitting, standing, walking ‚Äî based on muscle electrical signals.
- Support the development of **prosthetic legs** and **rehabilitation systems** by interpreting muscle movement patterns.
- Explore advanced architectures like **Capsule Networks** and **Transformers** for biomedical time-series analysis.

---

## üß© Research Motivation

The project aims to contribute to **intelligent prosthetics** and **rehabilitation engineering**.  
By decoding muscle activation signals, a prosthetic or robotic limb can:
- Understand the **intent** of motion (e.g., start walking, sit down).
- Adjust its movement accordingly.
- Support people recovering from injuries or with movement disabilities.

This work bridges **deep learning**, **biomedical signal processing**, and **assistive robotics**.
